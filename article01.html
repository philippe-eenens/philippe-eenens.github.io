    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>Abstract ... to be written.</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    
<p> Did you know that in France the wedge product is called "determinant"? 
I am quoting the official programme of mathematics (age 15 or so) from the ministry of education, 
so all the schools in France must adopt that terminology. 
</p>

    <h2>The best way to write the equation of a line</h2>
<p> They use the "determinant" terminology to generate the equation of a line in 2D. 
This is indeed the easiest and most efficient way to obtain that equation. If a line is given by vector w, 
then the wedge product of vectors x by w is zero for any vector x on the line. 
I first saw it in the book of Dorst Mann Fonteyn (with GA terminology of course). 
</p>


<p> But wait... how do the French find the equation of a line in 3D? Two 3D vectors do not form a square matrix. 
Yes, I know, you have already guessed what they call it in 3D. But please note the inconsistency. 
Students are taught meaningless tricks, and the connection between the 2D and 3D methods is lost. 
</p>

<p> Moreover, matrices and determinants are not part of the curriculum, at least not at that age, 
so there is no particular reason to use the word "determinant". 
</p>


<p></p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p> This is a clear example that GA is both urgently needed 
and totally appropriate for young students at pre-university level.

Looking for new insights into vectors, matrices, linear algebra, and geometric algebra? 
Look here for information on my forthcoming textbook, supplementary study material, articles, and research notes! 
My textbook uses an original, visual approach. The first volume deals with vectors and fully integrates the geometric algebra of Hestenes in a novel way.
